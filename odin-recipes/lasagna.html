    <h1>World's Best Lasagna</h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna was one of the first dishes I learned to make in college. The early attempts were based on an easy lasagna recipe that kept dishes to a minimum but still provided plenty of leftovers. When I would cook it, the irresistible aroma of melting cheese and robust pasta sauce would waft down the hall. It earned me a reputation as the cook on my floor. Before long, I started doubling the lasagna ingredients to make it in a huge disposable pan—perfect for feeding a crowd or for holiday occasions.

        After years of experimentation, I finally landed on the best lasagna recipe. Making the sauce from scratch takes a few more steps than a lazy lasagna made with store-bought sauce and precooked meat. But it’s always worth the effort. The leftovers freeze exceptionally well, too, so don’t be afraid to make an extra pan for later.

        The best part about this lasagna is that many of the steps can be done in advance. Cook the meat sauce a few days ahead, or prepare the entire lasagna ahead of time. It’s one of our favorite make-ahead freezer meals.
