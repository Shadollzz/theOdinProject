    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        Absolutely! This pizza caprese recipe starts with uncooked dough, so you can substitute a homemade pizza dough without changing the recipe at all. You can also start with a precooked crust, French bread or a soft flatbread, such as naan—just skip the prebaking step and start by adding the toppings.
        What else can you put on pizza caprese?
        Pizza is the ultimate add-what-you-like food—so experiment with toppings! Popular add-ons to any caprese recipe include artichokes, ripe olives and avocados. For an elegant touch, drizzle your pizza with a balsamic glaze. It’s easy to make; just combine balsamic vinegar and a sweetener—brown sugar, honey or maple syrup—in a small saucepan. The proportions depend on your taste; you can use anywhere from just 1 Tbsp. sweetener per 1 cup vinegar all the way to a 1:1 ratio. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until it's reduced by about 1/3.
        What's the best way to reheat pizza caprese?
        Don’t even think about using the microwave—we’ve found the best ways to reheat leftover pizza are in the oven, on a foil-lined pan, or in a skillet on the stovetop
